# AI Hardware Learning

This repository contains my learning journey and implementations related to AI hardware accelerators.

## MAC Unit
- Implements a basic Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit in Verilog
- 8-bit input and weight
- 16-bit accumulator
- Supports reset and enable control

Learning and implementing AI hardware accelerator concepts
## Verification

The MAC unit was verified using a Verilog testbench.

Simulation output showed correct accumulation:

6 → 26 → 68 → 110 → 152

This confirms correct multiply–accumulate behavior over clock cycles.
